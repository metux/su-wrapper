su-wrapper is an little util which lets special users
execute processes under another uid/gid.

it uses an table ( /etc/su-wrapper.conf ) to decide what
to do in certain situation. therefore it walks through
the table and tries to match the current situation
(the later entries have precedence).

the config table

    current UID  --+       +-- 
    current GID    |       |   exec UID
    argv[0]        | ====> |   exec GID
    argv[1]        |       |   exec cmdline
    ...          --+       +--
    
for more information please look at the su-wrapper.conf


Howto build:

    * make
      make install
    
    * edit /etc/su-wrapper.conf
